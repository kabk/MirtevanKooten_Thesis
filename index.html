<h1>0.0 The Starting Point</h1> 

The first half of 2014 I have lived in four different places, which, geographically, are opposites, spreading over different continents. The longest distance between the 'homes' I had claimed are 8500 km while the shortest distance between two places was a little over 13 km. One place I have called home for 10 years of my life, another for only 3 years. Another one I have been visiting for over more than 4 years and the last one was only my home for a little under 4 months. Even with all these numbers, it's not possible for me to draw a clear conclusion on what I would call my home. At one point, the most foreign place made me feel more at home than the one place I have lived a decade of my life. <br> <br>

So with all these solid facts we might try to define our homes with, how come they don't seem to add up for me in the most logical answer to 'what was my home during this period of half a year'? What exactly does this 'home' mean and where can I find it? It sounds like a rather simple concept – a place / area where we feel at our most comfortable. However, I think there is more to a home than a geographical place we are used to. It may be that a geographical home has lost some of its relevancy now we're able to travel and settle wherever we wish. <br> <br>

By reading this thesis, I would like to offer you a way to come on a journey with me in search of home. The term 'home' sounds so certain and is something we experience and rely on every day. It's a constant we are supposed to have. By going on this voyage I will try to define whatever it is that makes us feel at home. Trying to grab this 'thing' that's solely based on feelings might clarify more about this thought of home being just a place. <br> <br>

The mission of this thesis is trying to define whatever it is that makes you feel at home when, especially nowadays, home is not fixed at a specific place, but father a flexible variable or feeling. I will do this by starting at the first definition of a home we encounter. After that the journey in search of the definition of a flexible home will continue. The most solid form of a home will slowly disappear, as we look into different places, countries, buildings and objects that might define home. I will look at how the different places we call home all contribute to the definition of our homes. <br>

<h2>0.1 Preperations: The backpack </h2> 

During the journey of finding out home, we need to take certain objects to make it as comfortable and effective as possible. The backpack is a perfect container to store all the things we need, such like food, maps and knowledge, but it is also a good way to collect the things we encounter. These encounters, the discoveries we do while going on our travels, might help us get closer to answering our question of what is home. <br> <br>

In <i>The Global Nomad: Backpacker Travel in Theory and Practice</i>, it's mentioned how the backpack is an iconic image of the backpacker traveller. It's a symbol of today's increasingly mobile world. They carry with them not only the emblematic physical baggage that gives them their name, but their cultural baggage and as well. This cultural baggage contains knowledge of experiencing home in different places and under different circumstances. Eventually, this might help draw a conclusion on what is home. <br> <br>

This definition of the backpack (and the backpacker) is the first form of finding a home someplace besides your own 'true' home. Travelling is like taking flight to experience all these small homes, before returning back to your own. The home is still a steady factor within travelling, since it's the place that will be returned to after being away for a period of time.  <br>

<h1> 1.0 Childhood home  </h1>

The first home we encounter in our lives is the home we live in from the day we were born. For me this was the house I have lived in until I was eight years old. In this first place, you're not as conscious of the surroundings because of a young age. This home contains everything you need: family to take care of you. Including the neighborhood around this house, this place is your whole world.  <br> <br>

I never chose to live in this house, but I have lived here because my parents decided to. Therefore, this was not a home created by choice or because I was aware of my surroundings, but it became a home because of foundations I was raised in. <br> <br>

</p>

<p>

<h2>1.1 Home as a building </h2> 

The starting point of finding our home is at beginning, a fixed place we find ourselves in right now. It's the most iconic form we can think of for a home. A building, with a triangle shaped roof, two walls, a floor, an entrance in front and a window on the side. Include a font lawn and the neighbors, and a home is there. The first association with a home we have is a physical building. A place you have been sleeping in, eating at and returning to for the past period of time, may it have been a few hours or a few years. It is the touchable base you feel belongs to you, or perhaps you share with others. A home is the most stable place in our lives. <br> <br>

When wanting to get a general overview of the first impression of what makes a person feel at home, I decided to do a small research on questioning this to random participants. The website <i>www.omegle.com</i> is a website where you can ask such questions to a complete stranger from anywhere over the world.  <br> <br>

<img src="images/omegle1.png">
<BR><BR>
One answer I received very often was the answer 'home' or 'my home'. I feel like this refers to the actual building people consider their homes. It's the building they legally own. It seems that when people start to think of the concept of home, they automatically think of this physical structure instead of whatever defines this structure to be called a home. <br> <br>

One other first definition that connects to this is that home is the place you return to most.  <br> <br>

<img src="images/omegle2.png"><BR>

As mentioned by these strangers on Omegle, with the silly example of an automatic wifi connection on your phone, home is the place you visit very often and therefor are familiar with. It's the place that's the base you return to after leaving.  <br>

<h3>- evt project van playlab  hoe abstract kan de vorm van een huis worden totdat het onherkenbaar is?</h3> 

</p>
<p>

<h2> 1.2 The given home -> citizenship </h2>

From defining home is this physical structure at a certain place, how come we settle at such a place? The answer to this might be in the definition of home in the dictionary. <br> <br>

home  (h m) <br>
n. <br>
1. A place where one lives; a residence. <br>
2. The physical structure within which one lives, such as a house or apartment. <br>
3. A dwelling place together with the family or social unit that occupies it; a household. <br>
4. <br>
a. An environment offering security and happiness. <br>
b. A valued place regarded as a refuge or place of origin. <br>
5. The place, such as a country or town, where one was born or has lived for a long period.  <br> <br> 

In the dictionary home has several definitions. It's a place where one lives, a physical structure where a human can function. Another definition is a place, such as a country or town, where one was born or has lived for a longer period of time. Another point is the place you share together with family.  <br> <br>

Taking these several definitions, they come together as the determining factors of being a citizen of a state. Mentioned in the U.S. Code, laws made by the United States Congress, there are several laws that consider you a citizen of the state. The most up front ones are either being born in the US and being born outside of the US with parents that both have citizenship in the US. So our first definition of home could be considered citizenship and taking part of a nation you enter by birth. This is literally the first home we experience since our birth. This is where exploration of home has its roots. Do you feel like you belong at this place you settled by coincidence? If not, where do you start to search for a new home?  <br> <br>

Citizenship is a mandatory community we automatically take part in. This criterion of citizenship is one thing that keeps us legally attached to a place. This citizenship and the related set of responsibilities we get with it, is a strong influence to the first choice of a home. The place where you pay your taxes and go see your dentist is eventually the place you always have to return back to – whether you want it or not. It's a custom we participate in because it feels natural to do so from the start. <br>
As a citizen you contribute to the society, after which you gain rights in return for these obligations. Those who try to take distance of their citizenship and leave this system, get in trouble. It's not accepted to get more from the society than you give back to it.  It's a tight system designed to make life easier and more secure. Since security is one of the mentioned factors in the meaning of home, citizenship is a logical choice to start the foundation of home. <br> <br>
 
</p>
<p>

<h1> 2.0 Conscious Home </h1>

As we continue on the search for home, we encounter the second place we have called our home. It's the place we live at that we now, as we reach a certain age, have a conscious realization of. In my case, this was a place I moved to on the age of eight. After moving out of this house, I realized I had never actually considered the place itself my home. I had my own room and my family close, but it never was a place I made full decisions over. My parents picked the location, the house was also theirs, and within this set framework the only thing I had (considerate) influence over was one room in this building. <br> <br>

This made me question whether I really belonged at this place. What was the influence of this place towards my feeling of home? <br> <br>

<h2>2.1 Home Country </h2> 

Defining a fixed home, like mentioned in chapter 1.0, is not easy for every single person. In some cases it's not as upfront and easy like this. What if you consider different places a home? Pico Iyer, a British-born essayist and novelist, describes in his Ted-Talk how it's complicated to call a place a home when you have experienced several ones.
 <br> <br>
  The first association with home is this place of your roots. It's the place you associate with your parents. Iyer mentions how people expect him to say India is his home, since he's from Indian origin. The thing is, he has never lived in India a day in his life. So perhaps home is the place where you were born, raised and educated, in Iyer's case England. But what if one has left the country right after completing undergraduate education without having felt a real connection with this place?  <br> <br>

Then another option of home could be the place where you pay your taxes, go to the dentist and function as a citizen in this society. This is the place where you happen to be at the moment that could be considered as a home.
However, maybe the meaning of home is the place you want to be and try to spend most of your time. It could be the place you're dreaming of living, even though you might not be even close to be considered a habitant of this place.  <br> <br>

Having all these different places and several options of a home, it's getting tougher to discuss whether home is really tied to this certain place you have grown up at. This place gets less relevant and different factors depending on time and place together influence this feeling of home.  <br> <br>

Since it's easier to travel places these days, people are getting more international and multicultural than a few decades ago. This makes it difficult to maybe mention one place to call home, since there are several places that have an influence. Iyer mentions how a lot of people take little pieces of each of these 'homes' to create a new one.  <br> <br>

One example of an artist who plays with the definition of home very often is Do Ho Suh, a Korean sculptor and installation artist. After moving from Korea to the United States, Do Ho Suh has been working on installations that touch the physical distance between different places. One work of Suh, called <i>Home Within Home Within Home Within Home Within Home</i> is an installation that shows a life-size fabric replica of his first house in the United States and a replica of his parents' traditional Korean house in Seoul, hanging in the middle of the former. <h3>(Hier meer over de andere 'withins')</h3> Here he plays with the ever-expanding concept of space and therefor does exactly what Iyer points out; creating a new home with the components of homes from the past by combining these to form a new one. He shows how it's possible to consider different places a home. <br> <br>

<h2>2.2 A fixed Home vs flexible home </h2> 

Because nothing in today's world is near or far anymore, being abroad no longer means being away from 'home'. The idea of home starts shifting to nomadism, which denies the dream of a homeland with the result that home, being portable, is available, everywhere. <h3>(misschien wordt nomadism hier te vroeg genoemd -> verplaatsen naar later hoofdstuk en dit anders inleiden)</h3> A quote by John Berger, an English art critic and artist himself: "Home is represented not by a house, but by a practice or set of practices. Everyone has his own.""   <br> <br>

One artist who lives by this motto is Ana Rewakowicz, an artist based in Montreal with Polish descent, who explores the relations between temporal, portable architecture, the body and the environment by using inflatables.  <br>
In 2001, Rewakowicz covered an entire room in her apartment with multiple layers of rubber latex, which, once it was set, would form a transportable 'skin' of this room. It would transfer the original moldings and cracks, but also other remains like dirt and hair. By creating a second layer, she could inflate this room and create this installation, called <i>Inside Out</i>, which would give you an unsettling experience within this space. It would give the illusion of the stability and comfort we expect from a space like this, but inside this air-inflated room there is nothing to hold onto when losing your balance.  <br>
Three years later she decided to take her inflatable room on a trip through Canada for the period of one month. At different sites she would camp in the room, by trying to connect the ideas of 'home' and 'nomadism' with the very impractical 'tent' that would collapse after two hours of being inflated.  <br>

American Jay Shafer calls himself a 'Tiny House Designer'. When he decided he did not want to contribute to a household that's bad for the environment, he decided to build a house that is as small as possible, but with all necessaries for him to live in.  He takes away objects he doesn't need so he creates optimized necessarily, since he feels that that way life feels more necessary. One of the four tiny houses he has lived in was designed to be small enough to park on a car parking spot, just in case he might need to have to sleep on the streets of California.  <br> <br>

"By putting a house on wheels, [the house] is no longer a building, doesn't have to be built by building codes, and you can build It as small as you want."   <br> <br>

Shafer designed a house on wheels just to dodge the law in the US, but by doing this opened the possibility to use his house as a moving building. <h3>(evt. nog ergens toevoegen want dit is best hilarisch: As long as the house doesn't get too high, since you don't want to hit viaducts on the way.)</h3>

<h1> 3.0 Foreign Home </h1>

<h3>For a school exchange, I was able to call Seoul city, in South Korea, my home. The conditions of my actual home weren't ideal. I was sharing a 10 square meter room with a Korean stranger and all the belongings I could take were some clothing and a small amount of personal belongings. I remember when I unpacked my bags and put on my bed sheets, I spoke the words: "It feels more like home now." From that point on, it only started to mold even more into this place that made me feel at home. <br> <br>

Interestingly enough this place was most foreign and strange to me. It was nothing like I was ever used to before. However, it's a place I was able to explore on my own and therefor form my own opinion on it. It was a place that, over time, by getting familiar with it step by step, became my home. </h3>

</p>
<p>

<h2> 3.1 Nomadism  </h2>

If we want to look at how it is to live flexible, but to be still able to find a home in several places, we have to look at nomadism. Nomadism is a mobile way of living that's organized around cyclical or seasonal patterns.   It refers to a group of people who practice spatial mobility to enhance their well-being and survival. These were usual motivations for groups to live a nomad life. While nomads were often seen as 'wandering' across the lands without any specific patterns, now can be seen that the mobility is really a result of strategy depending on survival. <br> <br>

The definition of the word nomad can be traced back to the Greek <i>nemein</i> 'to pasture' and a nomad is defined as "a member of a group of people that travel from place to place to fine fresh pasture for its animal[s] and has no permanent home".  <br> <br>

The definition of a nomad comes down to one thing, which is basically people on the move and the reason behind such a move, which is fresh pasture. The other important definitional feature is the reference of a mobile and non-permanent habitat, or maybe only having a fixed home for some part of the year, who might be considered as 'semi-nomadic'.  <br> <br>

"A key feature of nomadic pastoralism is that these communities have social and cultural characteristics connected with the maintenance of herds and have adopted periodic mobility to sustain the use of the available land for their herds." <br> 

<h3>The word "Home" originates from the old English word ham, which means village, estate, town or place where many souls are gathered. (goeie source vinden hier voor graag!) It implies on a physical place where dwelling is involved, but mainly a place where a gathering of people is important.  <br> <br>

Iets wat onder dit kopje past maar nog geen idee waar: <br> <br>

When it comes to a living space, nomadism really brings one convenient form to mind: a tent. It's a flexible shelter, which can be brought along with a person, and could be seen as an extension of the individual and their clothing.  Whether tents are to be considered as real architecture or not is whatever makes them more interesting in the perspective of feeling at home. It rather becomes an object that could be carried close to you. As the historian Arthur Upham Pope, cited in "Architecture without Architects" catalogue, describes: "The magnificent structures have been the pride of monarchs of Western Asia for thousands of years, fabrications huge in size, very costly, and even if not permanent, often of extraordinary beauty." <br>
A tent can be customized to its environmental context, with the absence of solid walls and sealed doors and windows. It makes its composition a practice.  </h3>

<h2> 3.2 Global Nomads </h2>

Some say travelling has become and icon of the rootlessness and alienation of modern life.  Globalisation not only increases the speed at which cultures are marginalized, but also increases the speed with which the tourist can travel to see them. Therefor, the whole world is open to question our home and to take a second guess at where this might be. 
With the globalized world of today, there are many cases in which people leave their place of origin to either travel to discover new places or emigrate to settle at a new home. <br>
I would like to introduce the global nomads. With different motivations than nomads in communities and living in different locations because environment requires them to, global nomads choose to have a lifestyle without having a fixed abode, place of employment.  <br>
Some of them have parted from their country of origin. As Kannisto mentions, there are homeless, or - depending on your point of view - at home wherever they happen to be.  <br> <br>

Global nomads choose to avoid the sedentary societies that are built with the intent of making things permanent and continuous. By making this choice of not being an official citizen, and therefor to be 'homeless', they experiment with the feeling of home without it being tied to particular territories.  As sociologist Zygmun Bauman says, they are 'people of many places but no one place in particular'.   <br> <br>

Global nomads are not to be confused with long-term travellers. Even though they make extensive journeys, they always have a territorial home as an important reference point. Their tie to this place is strengthened by the future thought of returning back to it.   In Mobile Lives, it's mentioned how the mobilities lived by global nomads today seems more rootless and is not necessarily connected to a home, but more to several homes dotted throughout the world. <br>
Some might make the goal of travelling to come back and to contribute to society of what they've learnt. Global nomads don't have a goal like this, since they don't have the need to return back to a certain place after their travels.  <br> <br>

</p>
<p> 

<h1> 4.0 Someone's Home </h1>
<h3>
After visiting this place for very often, I lived for a short period of 2 months at someone else's home. Even though I considered this place as the spot to fall back on for this period of time, the house stayed exactly what it was: someone else's home. It had nothing to do with the person, but more as to me not being able to alter the space to my own needs. I didn't own anything and I didn't have a very fixed spot for my own belongings. This home made me realize that I think that home is definitely partly materialism and the feeling of owning a place. <br> <br>

--

Even though I thought this place would feel like home straight away, I realized after two years that it had not felt like home right from the start. I had a hard time 'committing' to this home, since I would go back to my parents' house at least every weekend. However, with my former home I started to feel alienated as well. The room I used to call my own, was lacking personal stuff that was now moved to my new place. I felt torn in between, since neither really felt like a home to me. <br> <br>

After leaving my student home for half a year, I realized that upon returning a home really was a place you could build. It was nice to return to a familiar place that was, in this case, entirely my own. I realized that with customizing this place to my own needs changed my actions within the home. With this, I eventually formed my own home. <br> <br>

<h2> 4.1 Home in Personal Objects </h2>

"It is these [nostalgic] longings, however, that do the most to shape the future, for every one longs for self acceptance, a supportive family/community, and justice in both the home and in the homeland. Thus, the relationship between home and self is reciprocal: home defines the individual, yet the individual defines home through choices about values, human relationships and self-expression. Individuals are both made by and makers of the ideological and emotional complex called home."  <br> <br>

- Finding a Way Home: A Critical Assessment of Walter Mosley's Fiction <br>
By Owen E. Brady, Derek C. Maus <br> <br>

The word nostalgia is a formation from the Greek words νόστος (nostos), which means homecoming, and the word ἄλγος (algos), meaning pain or ache.  <br> <br>

</p>
<p>

<h2> 4.2 Home in Industrialized Objects </h2>

One thing to question is that home might not be solely based on personal artifacts or objects. Due to industrialization and mass production, objects are not as personalized as they once were. Stores are selling the same products over and over again. We use those to form our new homes. <br>
Everyone has heard of an 'Ikea-home' - referring to a house filled and personalized with just Ikea products. Many people have the same Billy bookcase or Klippan couch, but even though they are industrialized products and not personal on first sight, they still add on to the feeling of home in most households. And even though Ikea tries to create this homely feeling by using 'feel good' and raw materials like raw wood and chest, metal and soft textiles, this is not necessarily the thing that makes Ikea furniture so comforting to people. <br> <br>

The thing that does create a personalized touch to Ikea furniture is the assembling of the Ikea products. We feel a sense of pride and ownership for these objects because we have put our own labor in setting these products together . Setting things together with our own hands, even though they are pre-made and result into the same thing 99% of the time, gives us back this personalized feeling we long for in a home.   <br> <br>
